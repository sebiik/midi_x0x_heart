
Midi seq v4, Arduino cv GAS logic?

Or +-12v, doepfer synth?

Arduino code: vibrato on mod wheel, mozzi bonus square osc?
Add m0xpd/ADSRduino pitch/cutoff envelope?


Pacemaker vcf input: level adjust switch (R19!)

Square wave shape: This was slightly different between my 303 and the x0x-heart. As usual, it's hard to say whether that is consistent across all 303's, but to get them to match on mine, i needed to add and extra 0.47uF across C11, and then it was perfect.
